<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>TARDIS is an open source radiative transfer code for simulating supernova spectra. We are dedicated to open source,
reproducible science, as well as mentoring new members of the TARDIS community! TARDIS has participated in the Google
Summer of Code (GSoC) for the last few years, and we highly encourage interested students to apply!</p>

<h2>Previously Accepted GSoc Projects</h2>
<p>These were the projects that we selected for GSoC 2016 (a while ago but still a good reference) and can serve as a
reference for future proposals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="../pdfs/tardis_proposal.pdf">2019 Accepted Application</a></li>

<h2>TARDIS GSoC Ideas Page</h2>
<p>We have compiled some background information about TARDIS and the science we do with it as well as some of our
suggested projects for GSoC 2019 on the <a class="reference external" href="../tardis-gsoc-ideas.html">Ideas Page</a>.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to come up with your own project ideas and discuss them with the TARDIS mentors. We're here to
help you become new open source developers, so don't be shy if you have any questions. The best way to get in contact
is to chat with us on <a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/tardis-sn/gsoc">Gitter</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-selection-process">
<h2>The Selection Process</h2>
<p>GSoC is about getting people involved and contributing to open source over the long-term. As such, we heavily weight
our application selection process towards students that are interested in remaining involved in TARDIS and open source
software development long after GSoC has ended.</p>
<p><strong>GSoC is not a job!</strong> If you think this is just a summer job, then GSoC is probably not for you. It's only like a job in
terms of planning your time commitment over the summer.</p>
<p>Additionally, submissions are graded based on perception of the submitter's abilities to complete the task within the
program timeframe, general consensus on the technical approach being proposed, and overall interest in having such
modifications made to TARDIS-SN. Particular notice is made of students that are responsive to questions and readily
interactive in the gitter channel. Communication is a great thing!</p>
<p>Just about every GSoC organization receives considerably more project proposals than can be accepted. Every application
gets read multiple times and reviewed in detail. Of those applications, only a small subset are selected, so keep in
mind that the selection process is rather competitive and difficult.</p>
<p>Whether or not you are accepted, contributing to open source outside of GSoC is one of the main goals of the program
and is the best way to be noticed and get your proposal accepted. Keep that in mind. Thanks for your interest and we
look forward to working with new TARDIS-SN developers!</p>

<h2>About GSoC</h2>
<p>Since 2005, Google has run an awesome open source software development program, called the
<a class="reference external" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a>
(GSoC), which specifically targets <strong>students</strong>. Under this program, Google funds students to write code for open source
projects during the northern hemisphere's summer timeframe. TARDIS, a scientific code to study exploding stars,
participates in this program to get young minds engaged in scientific software development. The process is as follows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>The student writes a project proposal for TARDIS.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Sometimes their project idea caters to something that the TARDIS collaboration suggests and sometimes it's an idea entirely of the student's conception.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Proposals are reviewed, evaluated, and ranked by the TARDIS collaboration.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Google allocates a certain number of slots to each participating organization.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>That, in turn, determines how many student developers work with the TARDIS collaboration.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This page will help you to familiarize yourself with GSoC, the TARDIS collaboration and provides a guideline for
applications.</p>
